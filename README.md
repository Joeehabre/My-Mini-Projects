# 🗂️ Personal Projects

Welcome to my collection of personal projects!  
This repository serves as a **central hub** for the small to medium-sized coding projects I've built while learning, exploring, and experimenting with different technologies.

## 🎯 Purpose
I created this repo to:
- Organize and showcase personal coding experiments
- Track my progress over time as I learn new skills
- Share mini-projects that solve real problems or just for fun
